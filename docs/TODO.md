# ToDo/Future Plans

## Short-term/long-term To-Do

**(?)** = Not sure if I can do this

- [ ] Add multi-bootsound support **(?)**
- [ ] Add a configuration file **(?)**
- [ ] Add more audio support (more support for file formats) **(??)**
- [ ] Add some sort of GUI for the sysmodule to change the sound/configure it
- [ ] Add a way to change the volume of the sound
- [ ] Check into the bug where certain MP3 files play at a weird pitch and speed
- [ ] Check into the bug where the sound cuts off early on some SD cards
- [ ] Etc...

## Future Plans

- [ ] Do research to see if the switch can have a button combination to play different sounds upon boot (i.e. holding L+R+ZL+ZR on boot plays a different sound than just pressing the power button)
- [ ] Potetnially Rewrite the sysmodule in C++ (I'm not sure if I want to do this, but I might)
- [ ] Brainstorm more ideas for this sysmodule
- [ ] Etc...
